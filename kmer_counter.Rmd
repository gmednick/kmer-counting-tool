Dear colleague, \
Thanks for sharing your concern about the k-mer frequencies in your experiments. I had a chance to look at the FASTA files and, as you suspected, the k-mer counts are not evenly distributed across experiments.  

This document contains a short analysis of the `challenge 1 FASTA files (Exp1-4)` and provides instructions on how to run the accompanying `kmer_counting_tool.R` script from the command line. I have the k-mer length set to 4, but you can change it to any value within the range of your sequence length when using the counting script.

## Import the FASTA file with the Biostrings package
The nucleotide sequence will be imported as a DNAStringSet object but I will convert it into a data frame and slice it into k-mers.

```{r}
exp1 = readDNAStringSet('takehome/challenge1/experiment1.fasta')
exp1
exp2 = readDNAStringSet('takehome/challenge1/experiment2.fasta')
exp3 = readDNAStringSet('takehome/challenge1/experiment3.fasta')
exp4 = readDNAStringSet('takehome/challenge1/experiment4.fasta')
#exp5 = readDNAStringSet("nonstandard_nucs.fasta")

fasta_files = list(exp1, exp2, exp3, exp4)

#Function:
#convert_to_tibble()
convert_to_tibble <- function(s) {
seq_name = names(s)
sequence = paste(s)
df <- tibble(seq_name, sequence)
}

fasta_df <- map_df(fasta_files, convert_to_tibble) 
fasta_df$seq_name = c('exp1', 'exp2', 'exp3', 'exp4')

# https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/issues/292
str_dice <- function(s, length) { # does not return list
   L <- str_length(s)
   str_sub(s, start=seq(1L,L-length+1,length), end=seq(length,L,length))
}

#Function:
#kmer_len()
kmer_len <- function(tbl) {
  tbl %>% 
    str_dice(length = 4) %>% 
    tibble() %>% 
    rename(kmer = ".") %>%
    count(kmer, sort = T, name = 'kmer_count') %>% 
    mutate(kmer = fct_reorder(kmer, kmer_count)) %>%
    mutate(standard_nucs = str_detect(kmer, "[non_stand_nucs]", negate = T))
}

```

## Table of K-mer counts by Experiment
This table is similar to the tab separated output file that is produced from the `kmer_counting_tool.R`.
```{r}
seq1 <- fasta_df$sequence[1] %>%
   kmer_len() %>% 
   mutate(experiment = 'Exp1_counts')
 
 seq2 <- fasta_df$sequence[2] %>%
  kmer_len() %>% 
   mutate(experiment = 'Exp2_counts')
 
 seq3 <- fasta_df$sequence[3] %>%
  kmer_len() %>% 
   mutate(experiment = 'Exp3_counts')
 
 seq4 <- fasta_df$sequence[4] %>%
  kmer_len() %>% 
   mutate(experiment = 'Exp4_counts')

sequences <- bind_rows(seq1, seq2, seq3, seq4) 

sequences %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = experiment, values_from = kmer_count) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**Kmer counts by experiment**"))  %>% 
  tab_options(container.height = 400,
              container.overflow.y = TRUE,
              heading.background.color = "#EFFBFC", 
              table.width = "75%", 
              column_labels.background.color = "black",
              table.font.color = "black") %>% 
  tab_style(style = list(cell_fill(color = "Grey")),
            locations = cells_body())
```

It may be helpful to visualize the k-mer count distributions to look for similarities and differences between the experiments.

## Bar plots of count distributions for each experiment

```{r}
#Function:
#create bar plots with bar_plot()
bar_plot <- function(tbl) { 
  tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(kmer_count, kmer, fill = kmer_count)) +
    geom_col() +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +
    theme(legend.position = 'none') +
    theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = "K-mer counts")
}

p1 <- fasta_df$sequence[1] %>% 
  kmer_len() %>% 
  bar_plot() +
  labs(title = 'Ex1 kmer counts')
  
  
p2 <- fasta_df$sequence[2] %>% 
  kmer_len() %>% 
  bar_plot() +
  labs(title = 'Ex2 kmer counts') 

p3 <- fasta_df$sequence[3] %>% 
  kmer_len() %>% 
  bar_plot() +
  labs(title = 'Ex3 kmer counts') 

p4 <- fasta_df$sequence[4] %>% 
  kmer_len() %>% 
  bar_plot() +
  labs(title = 'Ex4 kmer counts') 

(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)
```

Notably, experiments 1 and 2 are right skewed and experiments 3 and 4 are progressively less so. 

## Summary table 
The `max count` variation is worth exploring further.   

```{r}
#create a summary table with the median, min and max
sequences %>%
  group_by(experiment) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarize(`median count` = median(kmer_count),
            `mean count` = round(mean(kmer_count)),
            `min count` = min(kmer_count),
            `max count` = max(kmer_count)) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**K-mer counts summary table**"),)  %>%
  tab_options(
              heading.background.color = "#EFFBFC",
              table.width = "75%",
              column_labels.background.color = "black",
              table.font.color = "black") %>%
  tab_style(style = list(cell_fill(color = "Grey")),
            locations = cells_body())

#this table isn't very helpful
```

## Density plots
We can get a better feeling for the distributions with density plots.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
sequences %>% 
  group_by(experiment) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(kmer_count, fill = experiment)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~experiment) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(title = "Density distributions of k-mers (4-mers) by count",
       x = "Kmer count",
       y = "Density")
```

## Binning the kmer counts for a more general pattern
In the next two plots, the k-mer counts are grouped into 8 categories (10-80 k-mer counts by 10 and an other category). For all experiments, most of the 256 possible k-mers appear less than 10 times. So as not to dwarf the k-mer counts that appear more than ten times, it's better shown separately.

```{r}
sequences %>% 
  mutate(kmer_count = as.numeric(kmer_count),
         counts_bins40_200 = case_when(
           kmer_count <= 10 ~ as.character('10 and under'),
           between(kmer_count, 11, 20) ~ as.character('11-20'),
           between(kmer_count, 21, 30) ~ as.character('21-30'),
           between(kmer_count, 31, 40) ~ as.character('31-40'),
           between(kmer_count, 51, 60) ~ as.character('41-50'),
           between(kmer_count, 61, 70) ~ as.character('41-50'),
           kmer_count >= 71 ~ as.character('71 and greater'),
           TRUE ~ 'other'
         )) %>% 
  filter(counts_bins40_200 == "10 and under", counts_bins40_200 != '11-20') %>% 
  group_by(counts_bins40_200) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(counts_bins40_200, fill = experiment)) +
  stat_count() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Count of binned k-mers",
       subtitle = "The distribution of k-mer counts between 0-10",
       x = "K-mer count",
       y = "Density")
```


```{r, fig.align='center'}
sequences %>% 
  mutate(kmer_count = as.numeric(kmer_count),
         counts_bins40_200 = case_when(
           kmer_count <= 20 ~ as.character('10 and under'),
           between(kmer_count, 11, 20) ~ as.character('11-20'),
           between(kmer_count, 21, 30) ~ as.character('21-30'),
           between(kmer_count, 31, 40) ~ as.character('31-40'),
           between(kmer_count, 51, 60) ~ as.character('41-50'),
           between(kmer_count, 61, 70) ~ as.character('41-50'),
           kmer_count >= 71 ~ as.character('71 and greater'),
           TRUE ~ 'other'
         )) %>% 
  filter(counts_bins40_200 != "10 and under", counts_bins40_200 != 'other') %>% 
  group_by(counts_bins40_200) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(counts_bins40_200, fill = experiment)) +
  stat_count() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Count of binned k-mers",
       subtitle = "The distribution of kmer counts between 10-80",
       x = "K-mer count",
       y = "Density")
```

We see that experiment 2 dominates k-mer counts in the 30-40 range and experiment 1 dominates in the greater than 40 range.

I hope these plots help you narrow down the culprit behind your experimental variation. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions regarding the command line k-mer counting script.

## Instructions: k-mer counting script for the command line 
To help you check for imbalanced k-mer distributions in future experiments, I designed a k-mer counting analysis script that works from the command line. The k-mer counter let's you input a FASTA file and k-mer length, and returns a tab separated file of k-mer counts ordered by frequency. The program also returns messages about the analysis including: \
- Input sequence length\
- K-mer length\
- Which nonstandard nucleotides the program can identify\
- Whether the k-mer length is acceptable for the sequence range\
- The top 10 k-mers by count\
- Whether the given sequence contains standard or nonstandard nucleotides\

To use the k-mer counting tool: \
1. Download the directory I sent you and open it in the command line\
2. Change the permissions for kmer_counter_tool.R script to make it executable on your machine (chmod +x kmer_counter_tool.R)\
3. Then run the following incantation in your command line (with custom input and output file names):\
Rscript kmer_counter_tool.R 'input_file' kmer-length --output_file 'output_file'\
e.g., ![](kmer-count-input.png) \
4. See the image below for the expected output in the command line (Note: I am working on a mac). \
When running the script, a new output file (tab separated format) with k-mers ordered by frequency is generated.\
